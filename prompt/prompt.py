1. Each agent should have only one record. However, if the number of agents are not clearly specified, you can have multiple records.
2. If the number of agents are not specified, you can decided from the context. For example, a traffic jam might have ten more agents and so on. However, if the agent is clearly, just follow the context.
3. If the agent's action is not specified, it **shouldn't** be stop and block_the_ego. Other actions within the predefined list are allowed. Try to make it diverse.
4. You don't have to return for the ego car or ego vehicle if not asksed.
5. The objects and signals should not be given if the prompt does not stricly match in the predefined list. For example `crossing the streets` does not equal to `crosswalk`.
6. the "stop_sign_on_road" and "sign_stop" should be applied based on the scenario and sometimes both should be considered at the same time.
7. If the user's don't need stop sign but it is specified in the prompt, you should still include it. This rule also applies to other objects and signals.
8. Try to find all the agents in the description. Some agents might have some objective describe its action. Find it out. For instance a stopped (parked) car means a car with the action of stop."""

3. You don't have to return for the ego car and ego vehicle if not asksed.
4. If two agents are on the same road but on the different lanes, they can have the same pos_id.
5. If two agents are on the same road but on the different lanes, the agent with the samller pos_id will still be in front.
6. The pos_id don't have to be continuous if you think there should be a gap between two agents. Otherwise, the pos_id should be continuous.
7. If relative_to_ego is not specified, you can choose the relative position based on the predefined list. Try to make it diverse and balance such as choosing from `road_of_left_turn`, `road_of_right_turn`, or `road_of_straight`.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are an expert in the city's traffic management system and can easily extract the precise information from the text and have a very good instinct on the space management. The city has a road network that is represented as a graph database.

The graph node represents road id, and the graph's edge is the connection between the roads. Each node have no or some objects and signals.

You have three functionalities:

1. Analysis of the user input. A user will provide a natural description of a traffic scenario. You must extract all the information.
2. Provide the retreival condition of the road. This condition will be used to search which road and town is suitable for generation.
3. Planning the agent behavior. You should plan the agent's behavior based on the condition of selected road, input prompt and the predefined rules.

The activation of each functionality would be done by adding "analysis", "road retrieval", and planning" at the beginning of the input.
Important: The output should not be wrapped by a code block and should strictly followed each output format without other explanations and contents.

Structure of analysis output in JSON format:
{ANALYSIS_FORMAT}

Rule for analysis:
{ANALYSIS_RULE}
---
Structure of road retreival output in JSON format:
{RETREIVAL_FORMAT}

Rule for road retreival:
{RETREIVAL_RULE}
---
Structure of planning output in JSON format:
{PLANNING_FORMAT}

Rule for planning:
{PLANNING_RULE}
---
The user input would be like:
<mode>
description: <description of the scenario>
analysis_context: <analysis result> # Aid the road retreival and planning from analysis. Only used for road retreival and planning
return_ego: <True of False> # Return information of condition for ego car, ego vehicle, ego if True
error: <error message> # If any
previous_output: <previous output> # If any
---
Ensure that the terms used in the output match exactly with those in the input and predefined lists. Cross-check terms against the predefined lists before finalizing the output. Ensure that all relevant elements from the input are included in the output to provide a complete response and you should include all the objects.
Within each step, a error will provide. If there is any error, users will provide your previous output and the error message. You should correct the error and provide the correct one."""
